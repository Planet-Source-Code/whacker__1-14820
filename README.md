### Description

This code will allow you to modify certain advanced sections of the Windows registry. This example included shows how you can change the speed that the Windows start menu scrolls when clicked, will allow you to change the default startup page for Internet Explorer and for all you people who have had your web browser window changed by ISP to for example "Provided By ???".

The code will also demonstrate how to change the registered name and organization for Windows.

Please vote for me as this is my first submission.
